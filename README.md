## Familiarization
***Which one is cheaper?*** is a small website for determining which one among two products is cheaper.

Usage steps:
  1. Fill the first form with the ***price of the product*** and ***amount*** separated by space
  2. Fill the second form like in the first step
  3. Finally, press the ***Calculate*** button and get the result

## How it works
This website uses common javascript code stored in the index.js file. JS code simply devides the price by the amount and gets the ratio (price/amount). We can also consider this operation like calculating the price of one unit (kg,g,l etc). Then JS does the same operation to the second product, compares 2 ratios and shows the result.
